Values are: tRFC 

tRFC (Row Refresh Cycle Time): Time needed to refresh memory rows, preserving data integrity in RAM.

Secondary timings complement primary RAM settings for fine-tuning memory performance. They include parameters like tRFC, tWR, and tFAW, crucial for optimizing RAM efficiency and stability.

0: Do Not Adjust (2400Mhz: 93.3) (CUST_ADJ only)
1: 140 (Default timing)
2: 120
3: 100
4: 80
5: 70
6: 60

The higher - the better, but might affect stability.
