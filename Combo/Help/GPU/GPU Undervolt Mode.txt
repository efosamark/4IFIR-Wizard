GPU Undervolt Mode allows you to control the internal 4IFIR algorithms to either overvolt or undervolt GPU.

Overvolt (0) - increases the GPU power consuptions. Might improve RAM stability on higher clocks

Base (1) - sets the default power control algorithms.

Stage (2) - decreses the power consumption of the GPU.
